## Setting Up Your Environment

### System Requirements

Before installing Drupal 9.x or 10.x, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- PHP 7.4 or later
- MySQL 5.7.8 or later, or MariaDB 10.3.7 or later, or PostgreSQL 10 or later
- Composer (PHP package manager)

> **_NOTE:_**
> These requirements specifically apply to Drupal versions 9.x and 10.x. If you are installing an earlier version of Drupal, please refer to the respective documentation for the appropriate system requirements.
> 1. Drupal 10 requires at least PHP 8.1. PHP 8.1.6 is recommended.
> 2. Drupal 9.4 dropped official support for PHP 7.3. Sites on PHP 7.3 may still be installed and updated to Drupal 9.4 (with a warning), but their security coverage is not guaranteed unless they update to at least PHP 7.4.
> 
> Please make sure your system meets these requirements to ensure a smooth installation and optimal performance of Drupal 9.x or 10.x.

## Installing Drupal on macOS, Windows, and Linux

To install Drupal on macOS, Windows, or Linux, follow these general steps:

1. **System Requirements**: Before installing Drupal, ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements. Refer to the System Requirements section for more information.

2. **Install and Configure Web Server and PHP**: Set up and configure a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) and PHP on your operating system. Refer to the respective documentation for your specific operating system on how to install and configure these components.

3. **Install Composer**: Install Composer, the PHP package manager, on your system. Composer is required to manage Drupal's dependencies and facilitate the installation process.

4. **Create a New Drupal Project**: Use Composer to create a new Drupal project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```
   composer create-project drupal/recommended-project mydrupal
   ```
   This command will create a new Drupal project in a directory named "`mydrupal`" (you can change this to your preferred directory name).

5. **Set Up a Virtual Host**: Configure a virtual host in your web server configuration that points to the "web" directory of your Drupal installation. This step may vary depending on your web server and operating system. Refer to the documentation of your specific web server for instructions on setting up a virtual host.

6. **Complete the Drupal Installation**: Access your site through a web browser by visiting the configured virtual host (e.g., http://mydrupal.local). Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Drupal installation process. During the installation, you will need to provide database credentials and configure the site's initial settings.

By following these steps, you can install Drupal on macOS, Windows, or Linux. The general process remains the same, but make sure to refer to the specific documentation for your web server and operating system for any platform-specific instructions or configurations.
