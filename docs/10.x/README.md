# Drupal Documentation

Welcome to the Drupal documentation! This guide aims to provide you with an overview of Drupal, its concepts, and how to develop websites using Drupal. While this documentation is inspired by Laravel, it focuses specifically on Drupal and its unique features.

## 1. Introduction to Drupal

Drupal is a powerful and flexible open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. It allows you to build and manage websites, from simple blogs to complex enterprise applications. Drupal provides a robust architecture, extensive module ecosystem, and a flexible theming system.

## 2. Installation

To install Drupal, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Drupal from the official website.
2. Extract the downloaded files to your web server.
3. Create a new database for your Drupal installation.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the Drupal installation URL.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

## 3. Routing

In Drupal, routing maps URLs to controller functions. The routing system determines which controller should handle a specific URL. Routes are defined in YAML files located in the `mymodule.routing.yml` file.

Here's an example of a route definition:

```yaml
mymodule.myroute:
  path: '/myroute'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\mymodule\Controller\MyController::myMethod'
    _title: 'My Page Title'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access content'
```

In the above example, the `/myroute` URL is mapped to the `myMethod` method in the `MyController` class of the `mymodule` module.

## 4. Controllers

Controllers in Drupal handle the logic for processing requests and generating responses. Controllers are PHP classes that extend the `ControllerBase` class. They are responsible for rendering views, processing forms, and performing other actions.

Here's an example of a basic controller in Drupal:

```php
namespace Drupal\mymodule\Controller;

use Drupal\Core\Controller\ControllerBase;

class MyController extends ControllerBase {
  public function myMethod() {
    // Controller logic goes here.
    return [
      '#markup' => $this->t('Hello, Drupal!'),
    ];
  }
}
```

## 5. Views

Views in Drupal are responsible for rendering content. They define the presentation layer of your Drupal site. Views are typically defined using Twig templates, which separate the presentation logic from the PHP code.

Here's an example of a Twig template file:

```twig
{# themes/mytheme/templates/mytemplate.html.twig #}
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p>{{ content }}</p>
```

To render a view from a controller, use the following code:

```php
return [
  '#theme' => 'mytemplate',
  '#title' => $this->t('My Page'),
  '#content' => $this->t('Welcome to my page!'),
];
```

## 6. Models

Drupal follows an entity-based architecture, where models are represented by entities. Entities are objects that represent a piece of content, such as a node or a user. Drupal provides a powerful Entity API for creating, updating, and querying entities.

To define a custom entity in

Drupal, you need to create a new module and define the entity schema, storage, and controller.

## 7. Database

Drupal uses a database abstraction layer called the Database API. The API provides a consistent way to interact with the database, regardless of the underlying database system.

You can use the Database API to execute queries, insert or update data, and manage database transactions.

## 8. Forms

Forms in Drupal allow you to create and handle HTML forms. Drupal's Form API provides a set of functions and classes for building and processing forms. You can define forms, add form elements, and validate user input.

Here's an example of a simple form definition:

```php
namespace Drupal\mymodule\Form;

use Drupal\Core\Form\FormBase;
use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;

class MyForm extends FormBase {
  public function getFormId() {
    return 'mymodule_myform';
  }

  public function buildForm(array $form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    $form['name'] = [
      '#type' => 'textfield',
      '#title' => $this->t('Your Name'),
      '#required' => true,
    ];
    $form['submit'] = [
      '#type' => 'submit',
      '#value' => $this->t('Submit'),
    ];
    return $form;
  }

  public function submitForm(array &$form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    $name = $form_state->getValue('name');
    // Process form submission.
  }
}
```

## 9. Modules

Modules are an essential part of Drupal's extensibility. They allow you to add new functionality to your Drupal site. Modules can define new content types, provide additional fields, integrate with third-party services, and more.

To create a custom module, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory in the `modules` directory.
2. Create a `.info.yml` file to define your module's metadata.
3. Create a `my_module.module` file to define hooks and implement custom functionality.

## 10. Themes

Themes in Drupal control the visual appearance of your website. They provide templates, stylesheets, and other assets to define the site's layout and design.

To create a custom theme in Drupal, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory in the `themes` directory.
2. Create a `.info.yml` file to define your theme's metadata.
3. Create Twig templates to define the HTML structure of your theme.

## 11. Security

Security is of utmost importance when developing Drupal websites. Follow these best practices to enhance the security of your Drupal application:

- Keep Drupal core and contributed modules up to date.
- Use strong passwords for user accounts.
- Implement secure coding practices.
- Sanitize and validate user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Follow Drupal's security advisories and apply patches promptly.

## 12. Testing

Drupal provides a testing framework for automated testing of your code. You can write tests to ensure the correctness of your custom modules, themes, and other components.

The Drupal testing framework supports unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests. You can use tools like PHPUnit and Drupal's built-in testing tools to write and execute tests.
